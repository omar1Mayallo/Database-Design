# Database Design

In this repository, we will embark on a journey through the database design and modeling process, exploring each step in detail. By the end, we will implement database designs for real-world examples such as e-commerce systems, inventory systems, booking systems, PlayStation center systems, and more.

## Resources

The two main resources will be these books:
- [Practical Web Database Design](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4302-5377-8)
- [Beginning Database Design](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4302-4210-9)

Additional resources will include articles, videos, and more. The resource list will be updated with each new material studied.
